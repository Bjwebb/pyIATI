    Warning:
        The private attribute allowing access to the base Schema Tree is likely to change in determining a good way of accessing the contained schema content.

    Todo:
        Determine a good API for accessing the XMLSchema that the iati.core.schemas.Schema represents.

        Determine how to distinguish and handle the different types of Schema - activity, organisation, codelist, other.

        Args:
            name (str): The name of the schema being initialised.
                This name refers to a file contained within the core IATI resources folder.

            TypeError: The type of the provided name is incorrect.
            iati.core.exceptions.SchemaError: An error occurred during the creation of the Schema.

        Warning:
            The format of the constructor is likely to change. It needs to be less reliant on the name acting as a UID, and allow for other attributes to be provided at this point.

            The raised exceptions are likely to change upon review of IATI-specific exceptions.

            Need to define a good API for accessing public and private attributes. Requiring something along the lines of `schema.schema` is likely not ideal. An improved understanding of use cases will be required for this.

        Todo:
            Allow for generation of schemas outside the IATI SSOT.

            Better use the try-except pattern.

            Allow the base schema to be modified after initialisation.
